# Notes-code DELPHI 10.3
Code of the Notes program, developed by myself, used for study, currently in version 1.0

This program was created for study, you can use it and you can share it, you can't sell it I'm publishing the codes used here, you can open them in a text editor and compile with the DELPHI IDE, since it was created in this language.
Note that you can change and update it as long as you don't sell it, it is currently only available for Windows platforms, but in future updates it may be included in Linux.

This program can not only edit texts, but also save them in several extensions, for example, .CSS .HTML .TXT .BAT .VBS

Its facility is great, currently available in the Portuguese-Brazil language.

IMPORTANT if you are going to share this software, give us credit for the hard work and you are free to edit it and fix any bugs.
